# Advent of Code 2021

This is my attempt at solving this years Advent of Code. In previous years I have used [R](https://r-project.org/) ([2019](https://github.com/tomjemmett/advent_of_code_2019), [2020](https://aoc.tjmt.uk/)). This year I am going to try [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) instead!
